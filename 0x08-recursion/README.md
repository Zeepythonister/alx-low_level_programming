In this tasks, I will be practicing recursion in c programming language.
Task 0 involves wriiting a function that prints a string followed by a newline
Task 1 is a program that prints the reverse of a string.
Task 2 has a function that returns the length of a string.
Task 3's program returns the factorial of a given number.
Task 4 holds the function which returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
Task 5 will return the natural square root of a number.
Task 6 returns 1 if the imput integer is a prime number, else 0.
Task 7 returns 1 if a string is a palindrome otherwise, 0.
Task 8 has a function that compares two strings, then returns 1 if the string 
can be considered identical otherwise, 0.
