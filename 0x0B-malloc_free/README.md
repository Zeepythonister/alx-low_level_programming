This directory holds the solution to my practice of Automatic and dynamic
allocation, malloc and free in C programming language.

File 0-create_array.c has a function that creates an array of characters and 
initializes it with a particular char. 

File 1-strdup.c is a function that returns a pointer to a new string which
is a duplicate of the string str. malloc allocates memory for the new 
string while the space can be freed with free.

File 2-str_concat.c has a function that concatenates two strings with the
pointer pointing to a newly allocated space in the memory

File 3-alloc_grid.c is a programthat returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array
of integer,with each element of the grid initialized to 0. NULL is returned 
on failure.

File 4-free_grid.c has a program -that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created in the
alloc_grid.c function
